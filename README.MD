**Instructions to run the App**
- Launch Index.html on your browser.
- The page will load with google maps and a preset list of locations
- Type a locality or city or both, in the search bar and hit GO to
search for restaurants in the location.

**Functionalities of the APP**
- The app looks for locations based on the search value and returns the top 10 restaurants from the searched location. (In case fewer than 10 restaurants are found in a particular location, then the maximum available number from the search result will be shown).
- These results are displayed as markers on the dynamic map that pans and zooms to show you all the results.
- The names of the restaurants will also be shown on the list view on the right hand side of the screen (hidden by default on mobile screens).
- This list view can be hidden and made visible by clicking the hamburger menu button on the top left hand side of the screen.  
- Clicking on a marker or a list view item will highlight the corresponding items on the list and the map and show additional information related to the location.
The list can be filtered using the filter input box at the top of the list to show a smaller list of specific restaurants.
